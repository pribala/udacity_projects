#Portfolio Project Website

Based on the provided design mockup, the Portfolio Project replicates that design in HTML and CSS,  
developing a responsive website that displays images, descriptions and links to each 
of the portfolio projects completed throughout the course of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.

###User Interface

The website displays a header with the logo and developer details. It then displays 4 images using bootstrap grid layout.
Clicking on the images under Featured Work opens a modal window that describes briefly about the projects done during the 
course. Clicking on the link under the project title opens up a static webpage for each project created using Github Pages.
